# ‚ö° what this ?

This is a scan integration interface. The bottom layer is scanned by capturing packets**Can quickly scan ports and hosts and complete tasks across network segments**

## `üí°!importantÔºö`
####There are three requirements for building on the windows system environment:

You must use the rust version using the MSVC toolchain

You must install [WinPcap]Ôºà https://www.winpcap.org/ ÔºâOr [npcap]Ôºà https://nmap.org/npcap/ Ôºâ(using [WinPcap]Ôºà https://www.winpcap.org/ ÔºâVersion 4.1.3) (if using [npcap]Ôºà https://nmap.org/npcap/ Ôºâ, please make sure to use "in [WinPcap]Ôºà https://www.winpcap.org/ ÔºâInstall [npcap] in API compatibility modeÔºà https://nmap.org/npcap/ )‚ÄùÔºâ

You must put it in your bag. [WinPcap]( https://www.winpcap.org/ ÔºâThe Lib in the developer package is located in the directory named Lib in the root directory of the repository. Alternatively, you can use any location listed in the% lib% / $env: lib environment variable. For the 64 bit toolchain, it is located in wpdpack / lib / x64 / packet. For the 32-bit toolchain, it is located in wpdpack / lib / packet.lib.
```
# 1.install npcap server https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-1.70.exe
setx LIB E:\libs\LIB
# download and decompression https://npcap.com/dist/npcap-sdk-1.13.zip
# npcap-sdk-1.13\Lib\x64\Packet.lib put to E:\libs\LIB
```

# ü¶ä Applied Projects
[E-NetScan](https://github.com/EternalNight996/e-netscan.git): The network scanning project (which supports both command line and cross platform graphical interface) is under development..

# üî≠ why need to libscanners?
At first, I wanted to complete a cross network scanning project to help me complete some work. I referred to many open source projects, but these projects have some defects that do not meet my needs, so I have e-libscanner.
(process host and port scanning, and support domain name resolution, route tracking, fingerprint scanning, service scanning, asynchronous scanning, scalability and more)
The bottom layer is by calling [npcap]Ôºà https://nmap.org/npcap/ ÔºâAnd [WinPcap]Ôºà https://www.winpcap.org/ ÔºâPacket capture service;
The service API is [libpnet]Ôºà https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet );
